## A Standard Library for Microservices

[stdlib is a Standard Library for Microservices](https://stdlib.com)

### We just launched our Developer Preview!

Use stdlib to build production-ready, auto-scaled, "server-less" microservices in *minutes*.

stdlib has three components:

1. A central registry for microservices
2. A distribution platform for hosting at scale
3. A development framework for package management and service creation

It is the *fastest, easiest* way to begin building microservices on your own
or with a team, and currently supports Node.js 6.5.0. The distribution and hosting
platform for execution of your services is built atop AWS Lambda ensuring
both the scale and reliability you would expect for production-ready services.

You can view publicly available services [on the stdlib search page](https://stdlib.com/search).

# Getting Started

To get started with stdlib, first make sure you have Node 6.x installed,
[available from the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org). Next install
the stdlib CLI tools with:

```
$ npm install lib -g
```

And you're now ready to start building!

# Creating Your First Service

The first thing you'll want to do is create a workspace. Create a new directory
you intend to build your services in and initialize the workspace.

```
$ mkdir stdlib-workspace
$ cd stdlib-workspace
$ lib init
```

You'll be asked for an e-mail address to log in to the stdlib registry,
via the Polybit API server. If you don't yet have an account, you can create
one from the command line. Note that you can skip account creation with
`lib init --no-login`. You'll be unable to use the registry, but it's useful
for creating workspaces when you don't have internet access.

Next, create your service:

```
$ lib create <service>
```

You'll be asked for a default function name, which is the entry point
into your service (useful if you only want a single entry point). This will automatically
generate a service project scaffold in `stdlib-workspace/<username>/<service>`.

Once created, enter the service directory:

```
$ cd your-username/your-service
```

In this directory, you'll see something like:

```
- f/
  - defaultFunction/
	  - function.json
		- index.js
- package.json
- env.json
- README.md
```

At this point, there's a "hello world" function that's been automatically
created. stdlib comes paired with a simple `f` command for testing your functions
locally and running them in the cloud. To test your function:

```
$ f .
> "hello world"
```

If we examine the `f/defaultFunction/index.js` file, we see the following:

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

  callback(null, 'hello world');

};
```

If necessary, we can pass some of these parameters to it (`params.args` and `params.kwargs`)
using:

```
f . arg0 arg1 --kwarg0 "Hello World" --kwarg1 Goodbye
```

Though it won't change the function output as-is. `params.args` would be equal
to `["arg0", "arg1"]` and `params.kwargs` would be
`{"kwarg0":"Hello World","kwarg1":"Goodbye"}`.

## Pushing to the Cloud

To push your function to a development environment in the cloud...

```
$ lib up dev
$ f your-username/your-service@dev
> "hello world"
```

And to release it (when you're ready!)

```
$ lib release
$ f your-username/your-service
> "hello world"
```

You can check out your service on the web, and use it in applications at:

```
https://f.stdlib.com/your-username/your-service
```

That's it! You haven't written a line of code yet, and you have mastery over
building a service, testing it in a development (staging) environment online,
and releasing it for private (or public) consumption.

**Note:** You'll need to set `"publish": true` in the `lib` key of your
`package.json` file to see your service appear in the public registry. It's
set to `false` by default.

**Another Note:** Staging environments (like the one created with `lib up dev`)
are *mutable* and can be replaced indefinitely. Releases (`lib release`) are
*immutable* and can never be overwritten. However, any service can be torn down
with `lib down <environment>` or `lib down -r <version>` (but releases
	can't be replaced once removed, to prevent mistakes and / or bad actors).

# Connecting Service Endpoints

You'll notice that you can create more than one function per service. While
you can structure your project however you'd like internally, it should also
be noted that these functions have zero-latency access to each other. You
can access them internally with the `f` [package on NPM](https://github.com/poly/f),
which behaves similarly to the `f` command for testing. Use:

```
$ npm install f --save
```

In your main service directory to add it, and use it like so:

#### f/add/index.js
```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	return callback(null, parseInt(params.args[0]) + parseInt(params.args[1]));

};
```

#### f/add-double/index.js
```javascript
const f = require('f');

module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	return f('./add')(params.args[0], params.args[1], (err, result) => {

		callback(err, result * 2);

	});

};
```

In this case, calling `f ./add 1 2` will return `3` and `f ./add-double 1 2`
will return `6`. These map directly to individual service endpoints. **Note** that
when chaining like this, *a single service execution instance* is being used so
be careful about setting service timeouts appropriately.

# Accessing Your Microservices From Other Applications

As mentioned in the previous section, you can use the `f` library that's
[available on GitHub and NPM](https://github.com/poly/f) to access your
microservices from legacy Node.js applications and even the web browser. We'll
have more SDKs coming out in the following months.

A legacy app would call a function with...

```javascript
// Legacy code
var f = require('f');

f('username/liveService@0.2.1')('hello', 'world', {keyword: 'argument'}, function (err, result) {

	if (err) {
		// handle it
	}

	// do something with result

});

```

Which would speak to your microservice...

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	params.args[0] === 'hello'; // true
	params.args[1] === 'world'; // true
	params.kwargs.keyword === 'argument'; // true

	callback(null, 'Done!');

};
```

# Accessing Your Microservices Over HTTP

We definitely recommend using the [browser-based version of f](https://github.com/poly/f)
to make microservice calls as specified above, but you can also make HTTPS
requests directly to the stdlib gateway. HTTP query parameters are mapped
automatically to keyword arguments:

```
https://f.stdlib.com/username/liveService@1.12.2?name=Keith
```

Maps directly to:

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	params.kwargs.name === 'Keith'; // true

	callback(null, 'Done!');

};
```

**Note** that you will not be able to pass in anything to the `params.args`
parameter.

# Version Control and Package Management

A quick note on version control - stdlib is *not* a replacement for normal
git-based workflows, it is a supplement focused around service creation and
execution.

You have unlimited access to any release (that hasn't been torn down)
with `lib pkg <serviceIdentifier>` to download the tarball (`.tgz`) and
`lib get <serviceIdentifier>` to automatically download and unpack the
tarball to a working directory.

Tarballs (and package contents) are *closed-source*.
Nobody but you (and potentially your teammates) has access to these. It's up to
you whether or not you share the guts of your service with others on GitHub or NPM.

As mentioned above: releases are *immutable* and can not be overwritten (but can
	be removed, just not replaced afterwards) and development / staging environments
	are *mutable*, you can overwrite them as much as you'd like.

# Additional Functionality

stdlib comes packed with a bunch of other goodies - if your service goes down
for any reason (the service platform is acting up), use `lib restart`.
Similarly, as we roll out updates to the platform the builds we're using on
AWS Lambda may change. You can update your service to our latest build using
`lib rebuild`. We may recommend this from time-to-time, so pay attention
to e-mails and the community.

```
$ lib help
```
