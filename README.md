# Introduction


StdLib is the *fastest, easiest* way to turn functions into infinitely scalable, self-healing
web services. It has three components:

1. A central registry for microservices
2. A distribution platform for hosting at scale
3. A development framework for package management and service creation

StdLib is based on Function as a Service ("server-less") architecture,
popularized by AWS Lambda. You can use StdLib to build modular, scalable web services
for yourself and other developers in *minutes* without having to manage servers,
gateways, domains, write documentation, or build SDKs. Your development workflow
has never been easier - focus on writing code you love, let StdLib handle
everything else.

You can view services published by our large and growing developer community
[on the StdLib search page](https://stdlib.com/search).

# Getting Started

To get started with StdLib, first make sure you have Node 6.x installed,
[available from the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org). Next install
the StdLib CLI tools with:

```
$ npm install lib.cli -g
```

And you're now ready to start building!

# Upgrading From Previous Versions

If you're running a previous version of StdLib and having issues with the CLI,
try cleaning up the old CLI binary links first;

```
$ rm /usr/local/bin/f
$ rm /usr/local/bin/lib
$ rm /usr/local/bin/stdlib
```

# Creating Your First Service

The first thing you'll want to do is create a workspace. Create a new directory
you intend to build your services in and initialize the workspace.

```
$ mkdir stdlib-workspace
$ cd stdlib-workspace
$ lib init
```

You'll be asked for an e-mail address to log in to the StdLib registry.
If you don't yet have an account, you can create one from the command line.
Note that you can skip account creation with `lib init --no-login`.
You'll be unable to use the registry, but it's useful for creating workspaces
when you don't have internet access.

Next, create your service:

```
$ lib create <service>
```

You'll be asked for a default function name, which is the entry point
into your service (useful if you only want a single entry point). This will automatically
generate a service project scaffold in `stdlib-workspace/<username>/<service>`.

Once created, enter the service directory:

```
$ cd your-username/your-service
```

In this directory, you'll see something like:

```
- functions/
  - defaultFunction/
    - function.json
    - index.js
- package.json
- env.json
- README.md
```

At this point, there's a "hello world" function that's been automatically
created. StdLib comes paired with a simple `f` command for testing your functions
locally and running them in the cloud. To test your function:

```
$ lib .
> "hello world"
```

If we examine the `functions/defaultFunction/index.js` file, we see the following:

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

  callback(null, 'hello world');

};
```

If necessary, we can pass some of these parameters to it (`params.args` and `params.kwargs`)
using:

```
lib . arg0 arg1 --kwarg0 "Hello World" --kwarg1 Goodbye
```

Though it won't change the function output as-is. `params.args` would be equal
to `["arg0", "arg1"]` and `params.kwargs` would be
`{"kwarg0":"Hello World","kwarg1":"Goodbye"}`.

## Pushing to the Cloud

To push your function to a development environment in the cloud...

```
$ lib up dev
$ lib your-username.your-service[@dev]
> "hello world"
```

And to release it (when you're ready!)

```
$ lib release
$ lib your-username.your-service
> "hello world"
```

You can check out your service on the web, and use it in applications at:

```
https://your-username.stdlib.com/your-service
```

That's it! You haven't written a line of code yet, and you have mastery over
building a service, testing it in a development (staging) environment online,
and releasing it for private (or public) consumption.

**Note:** You'll need to set `"publish": true` in the `lib` key of your
`package.json` file to see your service appear in the public registry. It's
set to `false` by default.

**Another Note:** Staging environments (like the one created with `lib up dev`)
are *mutable* and can be replaced indefinitely. Releases (`lib release`) are
*immutable* and can never be overwritten. However, any service can be torn down
with `lib down <environment>` or `lib down -r <version>` (but releases
	can't be replaced once removed, to prevent mistakes and / or bad actors).

# Connecting Service Endpoints

You'll notice that you can create more than one function per service. While
you can structure your project however you'd like internally, it should also
be noted that these functions have zero-latency access to each other. You
can access them internally with the `lib` [package on NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node),
which behaves similarly to the `lib` command for testing. Use:

```
$ npm install lib --save
```

In your main service directory to add it, and use it like so:

#### functions/add/index.js
```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	return callback(null, parseInt(params.args[0]) + parseInt(params.args[1]));

};
```

#### functions/add-double/index.js
```javascript
const lib = require('lib');

module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	return lib['.add'](params.args[0], params.args[1], (err, result) => {

		callback(err, result * 2);

	});

};
```

In this case, calling `lib .add 1 2` will return `3` and `lib .add-double 1 2`
will return `6`. These map directly to individual service endpoints. **Note** that
when chaining like this, *a single service execution instance* is being used so
be careful about setting service timeouts appropriately.

# Accessing Your Microservices From Other Applications

As mentioned in the previous section, you can use the NPM `lib` package that's
[available on GitHub and NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node) to access your
microservices from legacy Node.js applications and even the web browser. We'll
have more SDKs coming out in the following months.

A legacy app would call a function (username.liveService with version 0.2.1):

```javascript
const lib = require('lib');

lib.username.liveService['@0.2.1']('hello', 'world', {keyword: 'argument'}, function (err, result) {

	if (err) {
		// handle it
	}

	// do something with result

});
```

Which would speak to your microservice...

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	params.args[0] === 'hello'; // true
	params.args[1] === 'world'; // true
	params.kwargs.keyword === 'argument'; // true

	callback(null, 'Done!');

};
```

# Accessing Your Microservices Over HTTP

We definitely recommend using the [lib library on NPM](https://github.com/stdlib/lib-node)
to make microservice calls as specified above, but you can also make HTTPS
requests directly to the StdLib gateway. HTTP query parameters are mapped
automatically to keyword arguments:

```
https://username.stdlib.com/liveService@1.12.2?name=Keith
```

Maps directly to:

```javascript
module.exports = (params, callback) => {

	params.kwargs.name === 'Keith'; // true

	callback(null, 'Done!');

};
```

**Note** that you will not be able to pass in anything to the `params.args`
parameter.

# Version Control and Package Management

A quick note on version control - StdLib is *not* a replacement for normal
git-based workflows, it is a supplement focused around service creation and
execution.

You have unlimited access to any release (that hasn't been torn down)
with `lib pkg <serviceIdentifier>` to download the tarball (`.tgz`) and
`lib get <serviceIdentifier>` to automatically download and unpack the
tarball to a working directory.

Tarballs (and package contents) are *closed-source*.
Nobody but you (and potentially your teammates) has access to these. It's up to
you whether or not you share the guts of your service with others on GitHub or NPM.

As mentioned above: releases are *immutable* and can not be overwritten (but can
	be removed, just not replaced afterwards) and development / staging environments
	are *mutable*, you can overwrite them as much as you'd like.

# Additional Functionality

StdLib comes packed with a bunch of other goodies - if your service goes down
for any reason (the service platform is acting up), use `lib restart`.
Similarly, as we roll out updates to the platform the builds we're using on
AWS Lambda may change. You can update your service to our latest build using
`lib rebuild`. We may recommend this from time-to-time, so pay attention
to e-mails and the community.
